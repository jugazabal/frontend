# Agent Instructions: Implement Fullstack Part 7 - React Router & Bloglist Extension

This module summarizes the key tasks covered in **Fullstack Open Part 7**, focusing on migrating an existing React application (the bloglist) to a multi-view application using client-side routing and managing application state with Redux.

---

## 1. Implement Client-Side Routing (React Router)

**Objective:** Introduce an illusion of different "pages" using the browser's URL without full page reloads.

### Core Tasks:

1.  **Setup and Initialization:** Install `react-router-dom` and wrap the top-level component with the **`BrowserRouter`** (often aliased as `Router`).
2.  **Navigation Links:** Create a persistent navigation menu using the **`<Link>`** component to navigate between views (e.g., Home, Notes, Users, Login).
3.  **Route Definition:** Define the components to render for specific URLs using **`<Routes>`** and **`<Route>`** components.
    * Example: `<Route path="/notes" element={<Notes />} />`.
4.  **Programmatic Navigation:** Utilize the **`useNavigate`** hook for actions that require navigation outside of a click on a `<Link>` (e.g., redirecting the user after a successful login/logout).

## 2. Bloglist Application Refactoring and Extension

**Objective:** Implement advanced features and state management for the bloglist application.

### Tasks:

1.  **Redux Refactoring:**
    * Migrate all application state, including blog posts, the logged-in user, and application notifications, from internal React component state to the **Redux store**.
    * Ensure all existing CRUD functionalities (create, view, like, delete) are driven by the Redux store.
2.  **Users View:** Implement a dedicated view (`/users`) to display a list of all registered users.
3.  **Parameterized Routes for Resources:**
    * **Individual User View:** Implement a parameterized route (e.g., `/users/:id`) to display a page for a single user, including all the blog posts they have created.
    * **Individual Blog View:** Implement a parameterized route (e.g., `/blogs/:id`) to display a single, full blog post.
    * **Data Handling:** Implement **conditional rendering** within parameterized components to prevent errors when navigating directly to a route before the necessary data from the backend has been loaded (e.g., `if (!user) { return null }`).
4.  **Comments Feature:**
    * Add functionality for users to post **anonymous comments** on individual blog posts.
    * Implement the frontend logic and a corresponding HTTP `POST` request to the backend (e.g., to an endpoint like `/api/blogs/:id/comments`).

## 3. Styling and Build Tools

**Objective:** Improve application aesthetics and understand the build process.

### Tasks:

1.  **Advanced Styling:** Apply a chosen method for styling (e.g., CSS modules, styled-components, or a CSS framework) to enhance the application's visual appearance.
2.  **Webpack Review (Conceptual):** Review the basic function and configuration of **Webpack** to understand how the React application is bundled for production.
